# Julia workshop at the University of Cincinnati

Welcome to the workshop on the [Julia language](http://www.julialang.org) to be held at the University of Cincinnati on March 22 & 23, 2018! It is run by [David P. Sanders](http://sistemas.fciencias.unam.mx/~dsanders/).

[Here](setup.md) is some information about setting up your environment and learning basic Julia syntax, so that we can progress more rapidly during the workshop itself.
